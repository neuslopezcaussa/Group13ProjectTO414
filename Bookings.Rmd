```

## 1. Let's import and understand the data
```{r}
bookings <- read.csv("bookings.csv")
summary(bookings)
str(bookings)
## This dataset is extracted from a hotel group and it explains its bookings and its characteristics. The main goal of this analysis is to optimize the reservations by predicting when the reservation will be canceled. This dataset consists of 32 variables that include integers and factors.

```


## 2. Data cleaning
```{r}
# 1. Solving NAs:
bookings$children <- ifelse(is.na(bookings$children),0,bookings$children)
bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights <- ifelse(is.na(bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights),0,bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights)
bookings$stays_in_week_nights <- ifelse(is.na(bookings$stays_in_week_nights),0,bookings$stays_in_week_nights)
bookings$reserved_room_type <- ifelse(is.na(bookings$reserved_room_type),0,bookings$reserved_room_type)
bookings$distribution_channel <- ifelse(is.na(bookings$distribution_channel),0,bookings$distribution_channel)


# 2. Simplyfing the dataset:
## A. There are 334 levels for the variable agent. We will keep only the top 5 levels.
bookings$agent <- as.character(bookings$agent)
bookings$agent.s <- ifelse(bookings$agent == "9", "9", ifelse(bookings$agent == "240", "240", ifelse(bookings$agent == "NULL", "NULL", ifelse(bookings$agent == "1", "1", ifelse(bookings$agent == "14", "14", "Others")))))
bookings$agent.s <- as.factor(bookings$agent.s)

## B. There are 353 levels for the variable company. We will keep only the top levels. NULL, 40, 223, 67, 45
bookings$company <- as.character(bookings$company)
bookings$company.s <- ifelse(bookings$company == "NULL", "NULL", ifelse(bookings$company == "40", "40", ifelse(bookings$company == "223", "223", ifelse(bookings$company == "67", "67", ifelse(bookings$company == "45", "45", "Others")))))
bookings$company.s <- as.factor(bookings$company.s)


## C. There are 178 levels for the variable country. We will group them by region.
# Note: most of the tourist come from Europe so we decided to focus on Europe 
levels(bookings$country) <- list( Southern_Europe= c("PRT","ESP","ITA"), Western_Europe =  c("GBR " , "IRL",  "FRA " ,  "CHE" , "BEL" ,  "NLD",  "LUX"), Cental_Europe = c("DEU",  "AUT" , "POL" ,  "HUN" , "CZE"), Northern_Europe = c("FIN" , "DNK", "SWE","NOR" ), Eastern_Europe= c("ROU","EST", "LTU","BGR", "UKR"), Eastern_Asia = c("CHN", "JPN", "KOR", "THA", "TWN","HKG "), Middle_East =c("ISR", "EGY", "JOR", "QAT", "OMN"), North_America = c("CN","MEX","USA"), South_America =c("BRA","ARG", "URY"))

bookings$country <- as.character(bookings$country)
bookings$country <- ifelse(is.na(bookings$country),"Rest of the World",bookings$country)
bookings$country <- as.factor(bookings$country)


## D. Groupign leading times into months 
bookings$lead_time<-ifelse(bookings$lead_time <= 31,"One Months", ifelse(bookings$lead_time > 31 & bookings$lead_time <= 62,"Two months", ifelse(bookings$lead_time > 62 & bookings$lead_time <= 93,"Three months", ifelse(bookings$lead_time > 93 & bookings$lead_time <= 124,"Four months", ifelse(bookings$lead_time > 124 & bookings$lead_time <= 155,"Five Months", ifelse(bookings$lead_time > 155 & bookings$lead_time <= 181, "Six weeks", "More than 6 months"))))))

bookings$lead_time <- as.factor(bookings$lead_time)

## E. Grouping number of week nights 
bookings$stays_in_week_nights <-ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 0,"0", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights > 0 & bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 1,"1", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights > 1 & bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 2, "2", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights > 2 & bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 3,"3", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights > 3 & bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 4,"4", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights > 4 & bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 5, "5", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights > 5 & bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 6, "6", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights > 6 & bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 7, "7", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights > 7 & bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 8, "8", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_week_nights > 8 & bookings$stays_in_week_nights <= 9, "9", "More than 9 nights"))))))))))
table(bookings$stays_in_week_nights)

bookings$stays_in_week_nights <- as.factor(bookings$stays_in_week_nights)

## F. Grouping number of weekend nights 
bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights <-ifelse(bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights <=0,"0", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights > 0 & bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights <= 1,"1", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights > 1 & bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights <= 2,"2", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights > 2 & bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights <= 3,"3", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights > 3 & bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights <= 4,"4", ifelse(bookings$stays_in_weekend_nightss > 4 &bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights <= 5, "5 ", "More than 5 nights"))))))

bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights <- as.factor(bookings$stays_in_weekend_nights)

## G. Turning the variables children and babys to a 0/1 if they have or not
#babies
bookings$babies <- as.character(bookings$babies)
bookings$babies.s <- ifelse(bookings$babies == "0", "No", "Yes")
bookings$babies.s <- as.factor(bookings$babies.s)

#children
bookings$children <- as.character(bookings$children)
bookings$children.s <- ifelse(bookings$children == "0", "No", "Yes")
bookings$children.s <- as.factor(bookings$children.s)

# 3. Column Elimination
## A. Deleting columns that have been replaced 
bookings$children <- NULL
bookings$babies <- NULL

## B. Deleting unnecesary columns
drops <- c("agent","company", "adr", "reservation_status_date", "assigned_room_type", "market_segment", "arrival_date_year", "arrival_date_day_of_month", "arrival_date_week_number", "arrival_date_month1", "reservation_status", "adults")
bookings <- bookings[ , !(names(bookings) %in% drops)]


# 4. Making dummy variables as we have multiple factors

bookings.dummy <- as.data.frame(model.matrix(~ . -1, bookings))
```

# 3. Preaparing data 
```{r}
# 1. Randomaze the data:
set.seed(65)
bookings.dummy <- bookings.dummy[sample(1:nrow(bookings.dummy)),]

bookings.dummy <- bookings.dummy[1:1000,]


# 2. Normalize the data:
normalize <- function(x) { 
  return((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}
bookings.dummy.n <- as.data.frame(sapply(bookings.dummy, normalize))

bookings.dummy.n$stays_in_week_nights9 <- ifelse(is.na(bookings.dummy.n$stays_in_week_nights9),0,bookings.dummy.n$stays_in_week_nights9)

# 3. Build train and test datasets:

library(caTools)
set.seed(123)
split <- sample.split(bookings.dummy.n$is_canceled, SplitRatio = 0.7)
bookings_train <- subset(bookings.dummy.n, split == TRUE)
bookings_test <- subset(bookings.dummy.n, split == FALSE)

bookings_train_labels <- bookings_train[, 3]
bookings_test_labels <- bookings_test[, 3]


# 3.1. Making sure they have a similar/logic distribution
table(bookings_train_labels)
table(bookings_test_labels)

```
