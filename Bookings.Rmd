## 1. Let's import and understand the data
```{r}
bookings <- read.csv("bookings.csv")
summary(bookings)
str(bookings)
## This dataset is extracted from a hotel group and it explains its bookings and its characteristics. The main goal of this analysis is to optimize the reservations by predicting when the reservation will be canceled. This dataset consists of 32 variables that include integers and factors.

```


## 2. Data cleaning
```{r}
# 1. Solving NAs:
bookings$children <- ifelse(is.na(bookings$children),0,bookings$children)

## H. Turning the variables children and babys to a 0/1 if they have or not
#babies

# 3. Column Elimination
## A. Deleting columns that have been replaced 
bookings$children <- NULL

# 4. Making dummy variables as we have multiple factors

bookings.dummy <- as.data.frame(model.matrix(~ . -1, bookings))
#str(bookings.dummy)
```

# 3. Preaparing data 
```{r}
# 1. Randomaze the data:
set.seed(65)
bookings.dummy <- bookings.dummy[sample(1:nrow(bookings.dummy)),]

bookings.dummy <- bookings.dummy[1:1000,] #instead of 80000


# 2. Normalize the data:
normalize <- function(x) { 
  return((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}
bookings.dummy.n <- as.data.frame(sapply(bookings.dummy, normalize))

bookings.dummy.n$stays_in_week_nights9 <- ifelse(is.na(bookings.dummy.n$stays_in_week_nights9),0,bookings.dummy.n$stays_in_week_nights9l)

# 3. Build train and test datasets:

library(caTools)
set.seed(123)
split <- sample.split(bookings.dummy.n$is_canceled, SplitRatio = 0.7)
bookings_train <- subset(bookings.dummy.n, split == TRUE)
bookings_test <- subset(bookings.dummy.n, split == FALSE)

bookings_train_labels <- bookings_train[, 3]
bookings_test_labels <- bookings_test[, 3]

#bookings_train <- bookings.dummy.n[1:95237,]
#bookings_test <- bookings.dummy.n[95238:119046,]

#bookings_train_labels <- bookings.dummy.n[1:95237,3]
#bookings_test_labels <- bookings.dummy.n[95238:119046,3]


#3.1. Making sure they have a similar/logic distribution
table(bookings_train_labels)
table(bookings_test_labels)

```


## 4. Exploring data 
### Graph 1
```{r}
# Exploring how many bookings are canceled and not  
plot(as.factor(bookings$is_canceled), main="How often customers cancel their bookings?", ylab="Number of cancelations",  xlab= "Is canceled", ylim = c(0,90000), col=c("green", "red"), legend.text = "0 = No, 1 = Yes", width=20)
```

### Graph 2
```{r}
#Exploring which month is the most popular for hotel visits
plot(bookings$arrival_date_month, main="Which month is the most popular?", ylab="Number of reservation",  xlab= "Month", las=2, names.arg= c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September","October", "November", "December"), ylim=c(0,15000))
```

## 5. Regression model
```{r}
## We will analyze the variable is_canceled. To do so we will do it by using a glm.

### We can see that there are two different types of variables. First, we will analyze the ones that are related to the person itself:
model1 <- glm(is_canceled ~ adults + children.s + babies.s + distribution_channel + is_repeated_guest + previous_cancellations + previous_bookings_not_canceled + customer_type, family = "binomial", data = bookings_train)
summary(model1)

## Revise the variables!!!
### Secondly, we will analyze the impact of the variables related to the reservation:
#model1.2 <- glm(is_canceled ~ lead_time + arrival_date_week_number + stays_in_weekend_nights + stays_in_week_nights + meal  + reserved_room_type + assigned_room_type + booking_changes + deposit_type + agent + company + days_in_waiting_list + required_car_parking_spaces + total_of_special_requests, family = binomial, data = bookings_train)
summary(model2)
```

```{r}

sapply(bookings.dummy.n, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

```


# 6. KNN Model
```{r}
# 1. Building the Model:
library(class)
## Note: we will use k= 34 as it is its square root.
model2 <- knn(train = bookings_train[ ,-3], test = bookings_test[ ,-3], cl = bookings_train_labels, k = 34)

# 2. Model Evaluation:
library(caret)
confusionMatrix(as.factor(model2), as.factor(bookings_test_labels))
```

# 7. SVM Model
```{r}
# 1. Building the Model:
library("e1071")
library(kernlab)

model3 <- ksvm(as.factor(is_canceled) ~ ., data = bookings_train, kernel = "vanilladot")
summary(model3)

# 2. Model Evaluation:
bookings_predictors <- predict(model3, bookings_test)
confusionMatrix(bookings_predictors, as.factor(bookings_test_labels))

# 3. Model Improvement:
## We will try different kernels in order to see which one has a higher accuracy.
model3.2 <- ksvm(as.factor(is_canceled)~., data = bookings_train, kernel = "rbfdot")


# 4. Model Evaluation:
## By improving the model we can obtain a %.
bookings_predictors2 <- predict(model3.2, bookings_test)
confusionMatrix(bookings_predictors2, as.factor(bookings_test_labels))
```

# 8. ANN Model
```{r}
# 1. Building the Model:
library(neuralnet)
model4 <- neuralnet(formula = is_canceled ~., data = bookings_train, linear.output = FALSE)
model4_results <- compute(model4, bookings_test[,-3])$net.result

# 2. Model Evaluation:
binary.is <- ifelse(model4_results > 0.4, 1, 0)
confusionMatrix(as.factor(binary.is), as.factor(bookings_test$is_canceled))

# 3. Model Improvement
model4.2 <- neuralnet(formula = is_canceled ~., data = bookings_train, linear.output = FALSE, hidden = 4)
model4.2_results <- compute(model4.2, bookings_test[,-3])$net.result

# 4. Model Evaluation:
binary.is2 <- ifelse(model4.2_results > 0.4, 1, 0)
confusionMatrix(as.factor(binary.is2), as.factor(bookings_test$is_canceled))
```

# 9. Decisions Trees
```{r}
# 1. Building the model:
library(C50)
model5 <- C5.0(bookings_train[-3], as.factor(bookings_train$is_canceled))
predict_m5 <- predict(model5, bookings_test)

# 2. Model Evaluation:
confusionMatrix(predict_m5, as.factor(bookings_test_labels))

# 3. Improving the model:
## We'll start by setting trails = 10, as it is suggested that it may reduce error rates about 25%. 
model5.2 <- C5.0(bookings_train[-71], as.factor(bookings_train$is_canceled), trials = 10)
predict_m5.2 <- predict(model5.2, bookings_test)

# 4. Model Evaluation: 
confusionMatrix(predict_m5.2, as.factor(bookings_test_labels))

```

## 10. Model combination by voting
```{r}
combined <- data.frame(model2, bookings_predictors2, binary.is2, predict_m5.2, bookings_test$is_canceled)

#Converting all factors into numeric forms for voting analysis
model2_f <- as.numeric(model2)
bookings_predictors2_f <- as.numeric(bookings_predictors2)
binary.is2_f <- as.numeric(binary.is2)
predict_m5.2_f <- as.numeric(predict_m5.2)

newcombined <- data.frame(model2_f, bookings_predictors2_f, binary.is2_f, predict_m5.2_f, bookings_test$is_canceled)

newcombined$voting <- ifelse(model2_f + bookings_predictors2_f + binary.is2_f + predict_m5.2_f > 3, 1,0)
newcombined$voting <- factor(newcombined$voting, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("no","yes"))
newcombined$bookings_test.is_canceled <- factor(newcombined$bookings_test.is_canceled, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("no","yes"))
