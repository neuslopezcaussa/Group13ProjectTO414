## 1. Let's import and understand the data
```{r}
bookings <- read.csv("bookings.csv")
summary(bookings)
str(bookings)
## This dataset is extracted from a hotel group and it explains its bookings and its characteristics. The main goal of this analysis is to optimize the reservations by predicting when the reservation will be canceled. This dataset consists of 32 variables that include integers and factors.

```


## 2. Data cleaning
```{r}

# 4. Making dummy variables as we have multiple factors

bookings.dummy <- as.data.frame(model.matrix(~ . -1, bookings))
#str(bookings.dummy)
```

# 3. Preaparing data 
```{r}
# 1. Randomaze the data:
set.seed(65)
bookings.dummy <- bookings.dummy[sample(1:nrow(bookings.dummy)),]

bookings.dummy <- bookings.dummy[1:1000,] #instead of 80000


# 2. Normalize the data:
normalize <- function(x) { 
  return((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}
bookings.dummy.n <- as.data.frame(sapply(bookings.dummy, normalize))

bookings.dummy.n$stays_in_week_nights9 <- ifelse(is.na(bookings.dummy.n$stays_in_week_nights9),0,bookings.dummy.n$stays_in_week_nights9)

# 3. Build train and test datasets:

library(caTools)
set.seed(123)
split <- sample.split(bookings.dummy.n$is_canceled, SplitRatio = 0.7)
bookings_train <- subset(bookings.dummy.n, split == TRUE)
bookings_test <- subset(bookings.dummy.n, split == FALSE)

bookings_train_labels <- bookings_train[, 3]
bookings_test_labels <- bookings_test[, 3]

#bookings_train <- bookings.dummy.n[1:95237,]
#bookings_test <- bookings.dummy.n[95238:119046,]

#bookings_train_labels <- bookings.dummy.n[1:95237,3]
#bookings_test_labels <- bookings.dummy.n[95238:119046,3]


#3.1. Making sure they have a similar/logic distribution
table(bookings_train_labels)
table(bookings_test_labels)

```


## 4. Exploring data

```

### Graph 2
```{r}
#Exploring which month is the most popular for hotel visits
plot(bookings$arrival_date_month, main="Which month is the most popular?", ylab="Number of reservation",  xlab= "Month", las=2, names.arg= c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September","October", "November", "December"), ylim=c(0,15000))
```
